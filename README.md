# MLLearning for Capstone 
You find the asked files: rmd-files, html-files, pdf-files and r-scripts on two analyses on the same wine data. First I ran machine learning regression models (linear modeling, decision tree and random forest). After this I redefined the dependent variable quality in high and low quality and ran a machine learning logistic model and looked at the predictions. In this last capstone excercise I tried to learn and use the modern 'tidymodels' workflows on regression and classification.
