# MLLearning for Capstone 
You find the asked files: rmd-files, html-files, pdf-files and data on analysis of wine data. First I ran machine learning regression models (linear modeling, decision tree and random forest). In this last capstone excercise I tried to learn and use the modern 'tidymodels' workflows on regression.
